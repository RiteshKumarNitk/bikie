# BIKIE — Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: API stays inside `apps/web`, no separate `apps/api`
Route Handlers already deploy independently on Vercel; a second app would add a
domain/CORS/cookie-sharing problem for zero present benefit. Revisit only if the
Flutter app needs the API to scale independently of the website.

## ADR-002: Dark theme is default, not just a toggle option
The product brief calls for a premium dark aesthetic (Dark Navy / Midnight Blue /
Deep Slate) as the primary identity, matching Linear/Notion/Tesla-style dark-first
products. Light mode is kept as an accessibility toggle, not removed.

## ADR-003: Dev server pinned to port 4000
Port 3000 is occupied by an unrelated project on this machine. Rather than fight
for the default port, `apps/web` always runs on 4000. SSR internal fetches derive
their origin from request headers (not the env var) so this doesn't create a
fragile dependency on the exact port number.

## ADR-004: Prisma 7 config split (`prisma.config.ts` + driver adapter)
Prisma 7 removed `datasource.url`; migrations run via `prisma.config.ts` against
Neon's **unpooled** `DIRECT_URL`, while the runtime `PrismaClient` uses
`@prisma/adapter-neon` against the **pooled** `DATABASE_URL`.

## ADR-005: Booking/Review/Trip/Partner modeled as first-class Prisma models
Added in this pass specifically to support seed data and the dashboards. `Partner`
is a profile attached 1:1 to a `User` with `role = PARTNER` (not a separate auth
identity) — one account, a partner profile unlocks partner-mode UI, matching the
"one account, multiple modes" principle from the original product vision.

## ADR-006: Font substitution — Geist Sans + Inter instead of Satoshi/General Sans
Satoshi/General Sans (Fontshare) require self-hosted licensing; Geist Sans (MIT,
official Vercel `next/font` package) is a close geometric-grotesque match and adds
zero licensing friction. Documented upgrade path: swap via `next/font/local` later
if brand assets are finalized.

## ADR-007: Better Auth `bearer` plugin for mobile auth
The web app was built cookie-session-only (Better Auth default). A native Flutter app
can't reasonably manage a browser-style cookie jar, so rather than build a separate
mobile auth service, `packages/auth/src/server.ts` adds Better Auth's built-in `bearer()`
plugin. Sign-in/sign-up responses gain a `set-auth-token` header; the Flutter app stores
that token (`flutter_secure_storage`) and sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Every
existing route handler already resolves sessions via `auth.api.getSession({ headers })`
(through `requireSession`/`requireRole`/`requireMembership`), so this required zero
route-handler changes — cookie and bearer auth now work side by side against the same API.

## ADR-008: Flutter font — Inter, bundled locally (not `google_fonts` runtime fetch)
No Flutter/Dart package exists for Geist Sans (see ADR-006 for why the web uses it), so the
Flutter app uses Inter instead — closest available geometric-grotesque match, same
rationale as ADR-006. Initially wired up via the `google_fonts` package's default runtime
fetch (downloads the TTF from fonts.gstatic.com on first use); this **crashed the app**
during Phase 1 verification on a fresh Android emulator with no general internet DNS
(reachable the host loopback for API calls, but not `fonts.gstatic.com`) — a realistic
failure mode for any device that's offline or on a restricted network at first launch, not
just an emulator artifact. Fixed by downloading `Inter[opsz,wght].ttf` (OFL-licensed, from
Google's official `google/fonts` GitHub repo) and bundling it directly as
`apps/mobile/assets/fonts/Inter-Variable.ttf`, declared in `pubspec.yaml`'s `fonts:`
section — zero runtime network dependency for text rendering.

## ADR-009: Brand accent changed to indigo (`#3B3A91`), split into fill vs. text tokens
Requested rebrand from the orange CTA accent to `#3B3A91` across both web and mobile.
`#3B3A91` contrasts well as a solid fill with white text (~7.5:1) and as text against the
light-mode background (~9.8:1), but as text/icon color against the dark-mode background
(the default theme, ADR-002) it's only ~1.8:1 — well under WCAG AA's 4.5:1 minimum. Rather
than accept that regression or water down the requested color, the accent was split into
two tokens: `--color-accent` (`#3B3A91` literal, for solid fills — buttons, badges, avatar
and chat-bubble backgrounds) and `--color-accent-text` (`#3B3A91` in light mode, `#8482D6`
— a lighter tint of the same hue — in dark mode, for links/labels/star-ratings/badge text).
Web: Tailwind classes `bg-accent` vs. `text-accent-text` (swapped project-wide from the
prior single `text-accent`). Mobile: `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary` for fills vs.
`AppTheme.accentTextOf(context)` for text/icons.

## ADR-010: Rides — request/approve join, keep the `Trip` model name, reuse `Conversation` for group chat, defer reputation/badges/tiers/clubs
Product direction shifted from "rent a bike" toward "find riders, plan adventures, ride
together" — a community layer on top of the existing `Trip` concept (which previously had no
working join mechanism at all; the web "Join Trip" button was a literal no-op stub). Four
scoped decisions, each chosen to minimize new surface area:
- **Keep `Trip`/`TripParticipant` as the model names** (DB table, API routes, DTOs) and only
  relabel user-facing copy to "Ride"/"Rides". A full rename would touch the DB schema, every
  route path, the DTOs, and the already-working Flutter trip screens for zero functional
  gain — Prisma model names aren't user-visible.
- **Request-then-approve, not instant join.** `ParticipantStatus` changed from
  `JOINED | CANCELLED` to `PENDING | APPROVED | REJECTED | CANCELLED` (migration:
  `packages/database/prisma/migrations/20260710120000_ride_request_flow` — the 2 existing
  `JOINED` rows in the live DB were remapped to `APPROVED` inline during the enum type swap).
  `seatsTotal`/`seatsLeft` unchanged; `seatsLeft` now decrements atomically on approval
  instead of on request.
- **Reuse `Conversation`/`ConversationParticipant`/`Message` for the "Ride Group" chat**
  instead of a new `RideChat` model — those models already support N participants with zero
  schema changes (only addition: a nullable `Conversation.tripId` FK). See ARCHITECTURE.md.
- **Deferred to a later pass, not built now:** rider-to-rider reviews (the existing `Review`
  model is hard-locked to `Bike`+`Booking`, can't flex — would need a new `RideReview` model),
  badges, membership tiers (Guest/Member/Verified Member — membership today is binary
  active/inactive, reused as-is via the existing `requireMembership()` gate for ride
  creation), and clubs. Reputation in v1 is a simple computed stat
  (`ridesOrganized`/`requestsSent`/`requestsApproved`/`ridesCancelled`/`approvalRate`), not a
  stored field.
