# Changelog

## Milestone 6 (in progress) — Mobile App, Phase 0
- Better Auth `bearer` plugin so non-browser clients (the Flutter app) can authenticate via
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` alongside the web app's existing cookie sessions — zero
  route-handler changes needed since session resolution already reads from headers.
- Real booking creation (`POST /api/bookings`, previously GET-only): computes `totalPrice`
  from the bike's `pricePerDay` × day count, defaults to `CONFIRMED` for instant-booking
  bikes and `PENDING` otherwise.
- Real review creation (`POST /api/bikes/[slug]/reviews`, previously GET-only), gated on a
  completed booking owned by the caller, one review per booking.
- Wishlist add/remove (`POST`/`DELETE /api/wishlist/[bikeId]`) — previously read-only on
  both web and mobile.
- Reconciled `.docs/API.md` with the real route inventory and documented the mobile
  bearer-auth flow.

## Milestone 3b
- SOS alerts now show complete reporter info (email, phone, exact coordinates with a Google Maps link) in both the dashboard and admin feeds.
- SOS Emergency (send, view, respond) gated behind an active membership; admins bypass the gate. Non-members see an upsell instead of the form.
- Referral system: auto-generated per-user referral code (`User.referralCode`, `User.referredById`), signup accepts an optional code (or `?ref=` link), dashboard Referrals page to share the link and see who joined, admin Referrals page listing all referrer/referee pairs. Tracking only — no automatic reward.
- Dummy payment checkout modal for membership purchase (simulated card form, fake processing delay, generates a `DUMMY-*` paymentId) replacing the instant-activate button.
- Admin Membership Plans management (create/toggle active/delete plans) — previously plans could only be seeded, not managed.

## Milestone 3
- SSE endpoint (`GET /api/sse`) + React hook (`useSSE`)
- `AuditLog` model, migration, repository, API route (`/api/admin/audit-logs`)
- Audit logging instrumented on all admin CRUD routes (users, partners, bikes, bookings, testimonials)
- Admin dashboard charts (recharts): monthly bookings bar chart, bookings-by-status pie chart, bikes-by-city bar chart
- CSV export API (`/api/admin/export?type=users|bookings|partners`)
- Email service (Resend-compatible) with admin compose page
- SMS gateway (Twilio-compatible) with admin compose page
- SOS auto-resolve cron endpoint (`/api/cron/sos-resolve`)
- SOS history API (`/api/sos/alerts/history`)
- Testimonial CMS management (admin CRUD API + management UI)
- New admin nav items: SOS, Audit Logs, Testimonials, Email, SMS

## Milestone 2
- Added `.docs/` governance scaffolding and root `CLAUDE.md`.
- Extending Prisma schema with Booking, Review, Trip, TripParticipant, Partner.
- Full seed data: Super Admin, Demo Partner, Demo User, realistic sample content.
